# VPC Endpoints vs NAT Gateway Cost Analysis

## Current Cost (with NAT Gateway)
```
NAT Gateway: $32.85/month (base) + $0.059/GB processed
Data Processing: ~$10-20/month (estimated)
Total NAT costs: ~$42-52/month
```

## VPC Endpoints Cost
```
ECR DKR endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB
ECR API endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB  
S3 Gateway endpoint: $0 (free!)
Secrets Manager endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB
CloudWatch Logs endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB
Bedrock endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB
Bedrock Runtime endpoint: $7.20/month + $0.01/GB

Total VPC endpoint costs: ~$43.20/month + minimal data processing
```

## Net Savings
- **Break-even**: VPC endpoints cost similar to NAT Gateway
- **Security benefit**: Traffic never leaves AWS network
- **Performance benefit**: Lower latency, higher reliability
- **Compliance benefit**: Private connectivity for enterprise requirements
- **Operational benefit**: No NAT Gateway management

## Data Transfer Savings
- **ECR pulls**: No internet egress charges
- **Secrets Manager**: No internet egress charges  
- **CloudWatch**: No internet egress charges
- **Bedrock calls**: No internet egress charges

**Recommendation**: Use VPC endpoints for security and compliance benefits, with cost-neutral impact.
